# Decrypt ncm file


## Try it!

```shell script
$ cargo run --release --example ncm_test "/absolute/path/to/your/ncm/files/in"
```


## Tips:

As far as we know from test, it's not quite stable, some converted files(.flac/.mp3) may have a very short interruption (< 1 sec).

But it's hard to happen:)
